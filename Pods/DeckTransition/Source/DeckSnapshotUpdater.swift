    /// In some cases this snapshot might become outdated before the dismissal,
    /// and for those cases you can request to have the snapshot updated. While
    /// the transition only shows a small portion of the presenting view, in
    /// some cases that might become inconsistent enough to demand an update.

    /// This is an expensive process and should only be used if necessary, for
    /// example if you are updating your entire app's theme.
