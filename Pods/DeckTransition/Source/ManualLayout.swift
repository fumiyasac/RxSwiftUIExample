    /// - On iPads, and with the single-height status bar on portrait, non-X
    ///   iPhones, the status bar is 20px, so the view is also inset by the same
    /// - With the double-height status bar on portrait, non-X iPhones, the view
    ///   is inset by 20 points since the containerView itself is also inset by
    ///   20 points
    /// - On iPhone X in portrait, the inset is the full height of the status
